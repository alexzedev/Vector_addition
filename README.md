Vector Addition in Mathematics is the fundamental operation of vector algebra that is used to find the sum of two vectors. Vectors are mathematical quantities that have magnitude and direction. A vector can be represented by a line with an arrow pointing towards its direction and its length represents the magnitude of the vector.

Vector addition is achieved by taking the vector in 3D or 2D and then arranging them such that, the head of one vector is arranged touching the tail of the other vector and now a third vector joins the tail of the first vector with the head of the other vector gives the sum of the vectors.
